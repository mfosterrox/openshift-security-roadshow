== Understanding the Paladin Cloud Dashboard

The main dashboard shows a variety of information pertaining to your clusters including a break down of violations. The violations are separated into Critical, High, Medium, and Low violations, with the quantity of each type of violation. 

The dashboard also shows the Asset Coverage, Top 10 Risk Scores by either Policy or Assets, as well as an Asset Graph.

The information displayed on the dashboard is linked to the Asset Group selected. In the case of the screenshot above, the Asset Group is currently assigned as All Sources. 

To change the Asset Group, click on Assets and select the asset you wish to see.
