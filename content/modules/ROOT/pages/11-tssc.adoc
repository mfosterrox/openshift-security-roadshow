== Module 11: Trusted Software Supply Chain

=== Goal of Module 11

The goal of this lab is to learn about the features from the Trusted Software Supply Chain suite of products from Red Hat. 


== Trusted Artifact Signer
Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer(TAS) enhances software supply chain security by simplifying cryptographic signing and verification of software artifacts, such as container images, binaries, and documents. 

Trusted Artifact Signer provides a production-ready deployment of the https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project] as a core component of the Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain product family.

Signing and verification, e.g. using GPG has been around a long time - why would someone found a new Open Source project to address signing and verification, you might ask.

=== *Why Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer?*

. *Supply Chain Security*: Modern software development requires robust
mechanisms to secure dependencies and artifacts, which GPG struggles to
address effectively.
. *Usability*: Developers need simpler, more intuitive signing solutions
without the burden of manual key management.
. *Transparency*: A centralized, tamper-evident log system ensures
accountability and traceability of signatures, enhancing trust.
. *Modern Identity Integration*: Sigstore aligns with contemporary
authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect), making it
easier to tie signatures to identities.
. *Automation*: Sigstore fits seamlessly into automated CI/CD workflows,
which are critical in modern software development pipelines.


These are bold statements, so let's quickly compare the two to better understand the advantages that Trusted Artifact Signer brings to the table:

==== *1. Key Management*

* *GPG*:
** Users must generate and manage long-term public/private key pairs
themselves.
** Keys are often stored locally, and their security is tied to the
user’s system.
** If a private key is lost or compromised, recovery or revocation can
be complex.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Utilizes short-lived (ephemeral) keys generated on-demand for
signing.
** No need for long-term private key management; keys are automatically
discarded after use.
** Simplifies key management for developers, reducing the risk of key
compromise.

'''''

==== *2. Trust Model*

* *GPG*:
** Relies on a *Web of Trust* where individuals sign each other’s keys
to establish authenticity.
** Trust depends on manual verification and key-signing parties, which
can be cumbersome and error-prone.
** Requires a high degree of trust in individual users and their ability
to manage their keys properly.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Leverages OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication, binding artifacts
to an identity (e.g., an SSO system such as Keycloak, a GitHub or GitLab account, email, etc.).
** Trust is rooted in central transparency logs (e.g., Rekor), ensuring
all signatures are centrally (or publicly, if desired) auditable.
** Encourages a more automated and modern trust model, simplifying
verification.

'''''

==== *3. Transparency and Verifiability*

* *GPG*:
** Signed artifacts and their signatures must be manually shared and
verified.
** No central or automatic system for transparency or revocation
tracking.
** Difficult to audit or trace all signatures and the associated public
keys at scale.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Every signing action is logged in a central, optionally public, tamper-evident
transparency log (Rekor).
** Anyone can independently verify the signing event and its associated
identity.
** Provides a centralized and automated system for transparency and
auditability.

'''''

==== *4. Ease of Use*

* *GPG*:
** Comparatively complex for users, requiring manual key generation, management,
and sharing.
** CLI tools have a steep learning curve and are not always
user-friendly.
** Widespread adoption hindered by usability challenges.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Streamlined experience designed for developers and modern workflows.
** No need to manually manage keys or trust chains; authentication is
identity-based.
** Easily integrates into CI/CD pipelines and modern development
practices.

'''''

==== *5. Security*

* *GPG*:
** Vulnerable to long-term key compromise if private keys are not
properly secured.
** Trust in signatures is tightly coupled to key security and revocation
is challenging.
* *Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer*:
** Ephemeral keys reduce the risk of long-term compromise.
** Transparency logs provide tamper-evident evidence of signing,
reducing the risk of undetected forgery.
** Designed with supply chain security in mind, reducing risks from
malicious dependencies or compromised keys.

'''''

==== *Advantages of Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer over GPG*

In summary, Sigstore is designed to address the pain points and
limitations of GPG in the context of modern software development,
focusing on ease of use, transparency, and security for signing and
verifying software artifacts.

* Eliminates manual key management.
* Provides automated, identity-based signing.
* Ensures transparency with central (optionally public) logs.
* Simplifies adoption with developer-friendly tools.
* Reduces risks from long-term private key compromises.
* Aligns with modern software practices and supply chain security
requirements.


=== Setup 
For this exercise, we'll be using the container image in Quay that we created during our Lab setup xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#build-a-container-image[Build a container image]

NOTE: Make sure you still have the variables set. If not, please go through the xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#build-a-container-image[Build a container image] section again to setup your environment and make sure you have pushed the image to Quay.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
----

For signing and verification of container images, we'll be using the `cosign` CLI binary, which has already been installed in your bastion host (and can also be downloaded from the OpenShift Console).

`cosign` can as easily be used in any CI/CD toolchain as we use it here and handles all the communication with the Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer services that request certificates, handle the OIDC authentication, store info in the transparency log (Rekor), etc.

`cosign` needs to be initialized with all the required endpoints that it communicates with. Additionally, during initialization, it will download the public trust root certificate in a local cache.

This initialization can be done via command line parameters or by setting environment variables that are read when no commandline parameters are present.

NOTE: Cosign itself doesn't need access to OpenShift, but since we have Trusted Artifact Signer installed on OpenShift (a RHEL installation is another deployment option), we will be using some `oc` commands to get the required endpoints.
Before proceeding, please verify you are still logged in to OpenShift via `oc whoami`

[[setting-up-the-environment-variables]]
To setup the environment variables, execute this script:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export TUF_URL=$(oc get tuf -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://$(oc get route keycloak -n rhsso | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')/auth/realms/openshift
export COSIGN_FULCIO_URL=$(oc get fulcio -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_REKOR_URL=$(oc get rekor -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.url}' -n trusted-artifact-signer)
export COSIGN_MIRROR=$TUF_URL
export COSIGN_ROOT=$TUF_URL/root.json
export COSIGN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="trusted-artifact-signer"
export COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_CERTIFICATE_OIDC_ISSUER=$OIDC_ISSUER_URL
export COSIGN_YES="true"
export SIGSTORE_FULCIO_URL=$COSIGN_FULCIO_URL
export SIGSTORE_OIDC_ISSUER=$COSIGN_OIDC_ISSUER
export SIGSTORE_REKOR_URL=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
export REKOR_REKOR_SERVER=$COSIGN_REKOR_URL
# to verify URL endpoints have been set
env | grep URL
----

NOTE: In case you're wondering why we define multiple variables with the same values: The upstream https://www.sigstore.dev/[Sigstore project^] has a long history, and some tools (like `cosign` and `gitsign`) use different environment variables for the same purpose. For various reasons (Open Source principles as well as compatibility), we are not branching off a specialized Red Hat version with simplified environment parameters. While these are maintained in the upstream project, they will be maintained in the Red Hat enterprise-ready version as well. 

As the last step, initialize `cosign`, so it knows who to talk to:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

=== Signing and verifying a container image

`cosign` will be interacting with the image in our private registry, therefore we need to login to Quay:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign login $QUAY_URL -u $QUAY_USER -p {quay_admin_password}
----


[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ cosign login $QUAY_URL -u $QUAY_USER -p MzI2OTI0
auth.go:203: logged in via /home/lab-user/.docker/config.json
----

TIP: To verify that the image we created xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#build-a-container-image[here] is still available and cosign can access the image, we can use the `cosign tree` command that checks for signatures, SBOMs (Software Bills of Materials) and attestations (e.g. build provenance attestation): 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign tree $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

        Note that there may be personally identifiable information associated with this signed artifact.
        This may include the email address associated with the account with which you authenticate.
        This information will be used for signing this artifact and will be stored in public transparency logs and cannot be removed later.

Go to the following link in a browser:

Enter verification code:

----

NOTE: As mentioned above, the signing process ties an identity (an OIDC identity, to be specific) to the signature. The signing certificate is issued on demand, but *only issued if an OIDC identity proof can be established*. 

In this example, the "OAuth2 browser based flow" is used. In other words, you will authenticate to the OIDC system by user and password via a browser login. We are running `cosign` in a `ssh` session with no connection to your system, therefore the check for a browser to open the login page fails: `error opening browser: exec: "xdg-open": executable file not found in $PATH`

image::11-quay-signed-image.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: You might ask yourselves - ok, but how would a pipeline task authenticate itself? A pipeline task can't open a browser to login... 
*Trusted Artifact Signer / Sigstore* (and the `cosign` tool as part of it) doesn't authenticate the user itself, but instead asks the *OIDC system* configured to authenticate the request before issuing a signing certificate. Therefore, all the flexibility of OIDC systems for authentication is available.

For example, *GitHub Actions* and *GitLab CI/CD* can pass the OIDC identity of the pipeline runner via OIDC tokens into the pipeline. 

In general, continuous integration (CI) systems focus on providing the identity of the build or deployment environment rather than the personal identity of a triggering user, to maintain least privilege and ensure reproducibility. 

But, depending on your CI setup and requirements, you can leverage the flexibility of OIDC to meet your needs.

**EXAMPLE**

In our workshop environment, we are using Keycloak as SSO / OIDC system. We can request a short-lived OIDC token from Keycloak and use this for authentication (and therefore, *signing* of the image).

1) First, we need to get the OIDC token issuer endpoint from Keycloak:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE=$(curl -s $OIDC_ISSUER_URL | jq -r '.["token-service"]')/token
echo $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE
https://keycloak-rhsso.apps.cluster-l2ktc.l2ktc.sandbox75.opentlc.com/auth/realms/openshift/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

2) Now, we are requesting a token from that endpoint for our signing user.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')
echo $OIDC_TOKEN
---- 

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ export OIDC_TOKEN=$(curl -s --request POST --url $OIDC_TOKEN_SERVICE --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=password' --data 'client_id=trusted-artifact-signer' --data 'username=jdoe@redhat.com'  --data 'password=secure' --data 'scope=openid' | jq -r '.["access_token"]')
echo $OIDC_TOKEN
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC...
...IgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJl
----

WARNING: This is just an example - naturally, in your own CI system, you would not use username and password of the signing user in clear text. Rather, you would store them in a Kubernetes Secret or in a Vault. Or, depending on your setup, you already have the pipeline user's OIDC token as environment variable during your pipeline run. Additionally, you wouldn't echo the token so it doesn't show in logs - even though it might only be short-lived, this is not a good practice. 

3) Now that we have the token, we can pass that to `cosign` for authentication:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign sign -y --identity-token=$OIDC_TOKEN $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0
----

Yes, tags can be reassigned and can be considered inappropriate for signing (and verification) purposes.

==== *Verifying Signatures*

Verifying an image signature is even easier than signing: 

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0 | jq
----

In this case, we are asking `cosign` (and therefore *Trusted Artifact Signer*) to verify if `jdoe@redhat.com` has signed this image. We can also use regular expressions, to check if anyone from Red Hat has signed this image, using `--certificate-identity-regexp`:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity-regexp ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@redhat\.com$ $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0 | jq
----

We can also verify that the person (to be correct, the OIDC identity) who signed the image was authenticated against a specific OIDC Issuer (using the `--certificate-oidc-issuer` flag) or against an OIDC Issuer somewhere in our domain:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cosign verify --certificate-identity jdoe@redhat.com --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp \.opentlc\.com $QUAY_URL/$QUAY_USER/ctf-web-to-system:1.0 | jq
----

NOTE: We are using `jq` for readability in these examples, it is not required.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

=== Signing and verifying git commits

TIP: Using traditional commit signing and verification methods required management and distribution of private/public key pairs to developers - a task that can become quite cumbersome for a large number of developers in your organisation. With *Red Hat Trusted Artifact Signer*, there is no need to issue/distribute/re-issue keys due to lost passwords/maintain a key revocation list etc. 


NOTE: If you haven't already done so, please execute the following steps from previous exercises:

1. We need a git repository for git signing, therefore please make sure you have cloned the workshop apps repository as shown here: xref:00-setup-install-navigation.adoc#deploy-the-workshop-apps[Deploy the Workshop Applications]

2. We won't go through setting up the environment for signing and verification (the Trusted Artifact Signer endpoints) again. If you have followed this chapter from the beginning, you have everything configured already. If not, please set the environment variables as shown xref:#setting-up-the-environment-variables[here], followed by a `cosign initialize`

==== *Setting up gitsign*

While you *could* use the `gitsign` CLI binary directly for signing your commits, it is much easier to configure your local (or global, if you want) `git` configuration, so that commits will be signed every time you issue a `git commit` or `git tag`, for example. This also applies to using your `git` installation from e.g. VSCode or other IDEs leveraging the local git installation.

Go to the `demo-apps` local repository you created earlier:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cd /home/lab-user/demo-apps
git status
git remote -v
----


[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ cd /home/lab-user/demo-apps
git status
git remote -v
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
origin  https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/mfosterrox/demo-apps.git (push)
---- 

Since we don't want to push our commits to the original source, we will use a GitLab instance on this cluster: 


You can access the => {gitlab_url}[GitLab instance UI^] on the cluster using

[cols="2,2"]
|===
|*GitLab Username:* | {gitlab_user} |
*GitLab Password:* | {gitlab_user_password} |
|===

TIP: You can also create an empty repository in GitLab with just a README and clone this to your console - but since we already have a repo, we'll use that. However, for our signing and verification exercise, the actual content isn't really important, so an arbitrary repo will do.

Your GitLab instance, logged in as user1:

image::11-gitlab-projects.png[gitlab ui]

So, before we proceed, let's quickly push our local git repo to GitLab:

[start=1]
. In our local repository, let's replace the origin with the a new one on GitLab:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export GITLAB_REPO_URL=https://$(oc get route gitlab -n gitlab | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')/user1/demo-apps.git
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin $GITLAB_REPO_URL
git remote -v
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ export GITLAB_REPO_URL=https://$(oc get route gitlab -n gitlab | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')/user1/demo-apps.git
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ git remote remove origin
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ git remote add origin $GITLAB_REPO_URL
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ git remote -v
origin  https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-47fg6.47fg6.sandbox2892.opentlc.com/user1/demo-apps.git (fetch)
origin  https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-47fg6.47fg6.sandbox2892.opentlc.com/user1/demo-apps.git (push)
---- 

[start=2]
. Now let's push it to GitLab

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git push --set-upstream origin main
----

Use the GitLab *username* and *password* from above.

[start=3]
. (optional) If you'd like to double check on GitLab, go to {gitlab_url}/user1/demo-apps[the app repo^]

image::11-gitlab-project.png[gitlab ui]

[start=4]
. Configure `git`

As stated above, we could use the `gitsign` command directly - but it is much easier to configure your `git` environment to use gitsign:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git config --local commit.gpgsign true
git config --local tag.gpgsign true
git config --local gpg.x509.program gitsign

----

==== *Signing a commit*

Now, let's quickly modify our repo and commit the changes (you can of course make any modification you like, we'll simply add an empty file)

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
touch make-a-commit.txt
git add .
git status
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ touch make-a-commit.txt
git add .
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   make-a-commit.txt
----

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git commit -m "added an empty file"
----

NOTE: Similarly to signing an image, you will be asked to open your browser to the OIDC System (in our case Keycloak) to authenticate. This is because you are working in an SSH session with no connection to your local computer, so it can't automatically open your browser. 

Please use the "signing user" *`jdoe@redhat.com`* with password *`secure`* again.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion demo-apps]$ git commit -m "added an empty file"

Your name and email address were configured automatically based
on your username and hostname. Please check that they are accurate.
You can suppress this message by setting them explicitly. Run the
following command and follow the instructions in your editor to edit
your configuration file:

    git config --global --edit

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 make-a-commit.txt
----

TIP: `gitsign` doesn't echo the output of the verification code, so don't worry if you don't see it when pasting from your browser. 

image::11-signing-sso-login.png[keycloak login]

image::11-signing-successcode.png[copy the success code]

IMPORTANT: If you look closer at the `git` console output, you will notice that you have commited your code change as "Red Hat Demo Platform Student". That is because your git environment hasn't been configured with an explicit user. It is important to understand that we have two user types here - and depending on your requirements, these can be the same or different users: Firstly, the *committer*. This is what `git` is storing as the user metadata. However, this is not secure, as it can be changed easily, just by configuring your local `git` environment. Secondly, the *signer* - in our case, "jdoe@redhat.com". Since that user just authenticated against the "Company SSO" (Keycloak), this signature is safe - and furthermore, the signing event in the transparency log cannot be altered. This also gives a user the option to work in different git systems with different committer IDs - but all commits would be signed with the same identifiable OIDC identity. 

Now we can push the signed commit to our remote GitLab repository:

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
git push
----

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

----

NOTE: If you check the GitLab repository after you pushed the commit, you might have noticed the "unverified" badge. It means that GitLab recognizes that the commit has been signed, but currently GitLab cannot verify "keyless" signatures - however, given the demand and ease of use of Sigstore / Trusted Artifact Signer, many vendors (including the GitLab community and company backing it) are working on it: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364428[GitLab issue^]

==== *Verifying a commit signature*

//TODO



== Trusted Profile Analyzer 
The Trusted Profile Analyzer adds management capabilities for *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to OpenShift. 

=== *What is an SBOM?* 
https://www.cisa.gov[CISA.gov] defines an SBOM as "a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components." https://www.cisa.gov/sbom[¹] 

Using SBOMs, you can have a clear vision of everything that goes into your application or what you may have received from vendors, such as Red Hat. This enables platform engineers to more easily enforce operational controls and compliance across hybrid multi-cloud environments. 

In addition, several regulatory requirements and frameworks either *mandate* or *recommend* the use of *Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs)* to enhance software supply chain transparency and security. Here are some key examples, but the list is continually growing:


==== *1. U.S. Executive Order 14028 (Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity)*

* *Mandate*: In May 2021, this Executive Order directed the U.S.
government to take actions to secure the software supply chain.
* *SBOM Requirement*:
** The *National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA)* was tasked with defining minimum elements for SBOMs.
** Vendors providing software to federal agencies must provide SBOMs as
part of their cybersecurity practices.
** Goal: Increase transparency about software components to mitigate
risks from vulnerabilities.



==== *2. EU Cyber Resilience Act*

* *Proposed Mandate*: Expected to become law in the near future, this
act will apply to products with digital elements in the EU.
* *SBOM Requirement*: It encourages or requires organizations to
maintain transparency about their software dependencies, including
SBOMs, for compliance with security standards.



==== *3. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance*

* *Recommendation*: The FDA issued guidance for medical device
manufacturers to include SBOMs.
* *Context*: As part of the *Pre-market Cybersecurity Guidance* for
medical devices, manufacturers are encouraged to provide SBOMs to
identify vulnerabilities in device software and support risk management.
* *Goal*: Protect healthcare systems and patient safety.


==== *4. OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)*

* *Recommendation*: OWASP promotes SBOMs as part of software composition
analysis (SCA) to track components and identify vulnerabilities.
* *Context*: Although not a regulatory requirement, it is widely
recognized in cybersecurity best practices.



==== *5. CISA Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 23-01*

* *Mandate*: U.S. government agencies are required to track and mitigate
known vulnerabilities in software they use.
* *SBOM Role*: Although the directive doesn’t explicitly mandate SBOMs,
managing them is critical to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
efficiently.



==== *6. ISO/IEC 5962 (SBOM Standard)*

* *Recommendation*: This international standard formalizes SBOM
structure, ensuring consistent implementation across industries. It
supports compliance with regulatory and industry standards requiring
software transparency.



==== *7. Proposed SEC Cybersecurity Rules*

* *Recommendation*: Companies under U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) regulations must report cybersecurity risks, including
supply chain vulnerabilities. SBOMs can help meet these transparency
requirements.



=== *Why SBOMs are Becoming Standard in Regulations*

* *Transparency*: Knowing what’s in your software reduces the risk of
vulnerabilities.
* *Risk Management*: SBOMs help identify, track, and remediate issues in
the software supply chain.
* *Compliance*: They demonstrate adherence to evolving cybersecurity and
data privacy laws.

*As cybersecurity frameworks continue to evolve, the use of SBOMs is increasingly seen as foundational for compliance and risk mitigation.*

=== *Using the Trusted Profile Analyzer UI*

A Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer has been created for you to use. The proctor will make the URL available to you once you've completed the previous section. 

When you are given the URL, log into the RHTPA UI using the username and password provided.

image::lab11.1-tpa.png[]

You can search for an SBOM, advisory, or CVE directly from the home page, or you can click on Search in the left menu for further options. 

image::lab11.2-tpa.gif[]

From the Search page, you can choose to browse SBOMs, Packages, CVEs, and Advisories from the Tabs, and further filter using the filter menu on the left. 

Let's take a look at some packages. 

Click the Packages tab, then check the Red Hat box under supplier. 

The list now shows packages that are supplied by Red Hat. 

You may click on a package to get information like related vulnerabilities, if any exist, and related products. 

==== Uploading an SBOM

An SBOM has been made available for you to download https://github.com/SeanRickerd/sbom/blob/main/home-banking-bom.json[here].

Upload the SBOM. 

image::lab11.1-sbom.gif[lab11.1]

It will take a few minutes for the SBOM to be processed by TPA, so click in the Search bar and type "home". Once you see home-banking, click on it. 

image::lab11.2-sbom.gif[lab11.2] 

This will open the page for the home-banking SBOM you've uploaded. 

The Info tab will give you standard information about the SBOM itself, including the version, the CycloneDX version, and the serial number. 

Click on the Packages tab. 

image::lab11.3-sbom.png[lab11.3]

The Packages tab will list all the packages found in this SBOM. 

Click on Dependency Analytics Report. 

The Dependency Analytics Report tab will list the security issues found in this SBOM. As you can see, there are a number of violations found. 3 of them are Critical, 3 High, and 2 Medium. 

Scroll down the page to find the osv tab. 

Here you will find further information about the detected vulnerabilities. Clicking on the Direct Vulnerabilities to the right of the log4j entry will expand the entry to show more information about he vulnerabilities, including Remediation. 

The same can be done with the Transitive Vulnerabilites next to the struts2-core entry. 

image::lab11.4-sbom.gif[lab11.4]
