== RHACS Log4Shell Vulnerability Quick Lab

This lab shows how to block workloads with Log4Shell vulnerabilities using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS).

.Goals
* Block the vulnerable deployment of a log4shell application
* Craft a policy to block the deployment of any application that uses log4shell
* Verify the policy in the RHACS console

== 1. Clean Up Environment

Run these commands to reset your environment:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
if oc get project log4shell &>/dev/null; then
  oc delete project log4shell
else
  echo "Project 'log4shell' already cleaned up."
fi

if [ -f ~/deploy.yaml ]; then
  rm -f ~/deploy.yaml
else
  echo "'~/deploy.yaml' already cleaned up."
fi

POL_ID=$(curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" "https://$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS/v1/policies" | jq -r '.policies[] | select(.isDefault|not) | .id')
if [ -n "$POL_ID" ] && [ "$POL_ID" != "null" ]; then
  curl -k -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" "https://$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS/v1/policies/$POL_ID"
else
  echo "Policy already cleaned up."
fi
----

== 2. Deploy Vulnerable Application

Awesome! You're ready to go. Now, create a new project and deploy the vulnerable Log4Shell app:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project log4shell
cat << EOF > ~/deploy.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: log4shell
  namespace: log4shell
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deployment: log4shell
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        deployment: log4shell
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: log4shell
        image: quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
      restartPolicy: Always
EOF
oc create -f ~/deploy.yaml
----

Check the pod status:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -l deployment=log4shell -n log4shell
----

NOTE: You can add -w to the command to watch the pod status.

[.console-output]
[source,sh]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ oc get pods -l deployment=log4shell -n log4shell
NAME                         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
log4shell-6454cfb8c9-whskt   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          9s
log4shell-6454cfb8c9-whskt   1/1     Running             0          12s
----


== 3. Verify Vulnerability

Scan the image to confirm the Log4Shell vulnerability is present:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
roxctl --insecure-skip-tls-verify -e "$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443" image scan --image=quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0 --force -o table --severity=CRITICAL
----

[.console-output]
[source,sh]
----
Scan results for image: quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0
(TOTAL-COMPONENTS: 5, TOTAL-VULNERABILITIES: 4, LOW: 0, MODERATE: 0, IMPORTANT: 0, CRITICAL: 4)

WARN:   A total of 4 unique vulnerabilities were found in 5 components
----

Look for CVE-2021-44228 in the output. It should be at the top of the list.

== 4. Review the Vulnerability in the RHACS Console

Quickly identifying a vulnerability with RHACS enables you to proactively protect your workloads, minimize risk, and respond to security threats before they can be exploited.

1. In the RHACS console, go to the **Results** page under the vulnerability management tab.

image::BH-log4shell-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
2. Filter for the Log4Shell CVE (CVE-2021-44228).

image::BH-log4shell-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
3. Click on the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability to see the details.

image::BH-log4shell-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
4. Click on the **quay.io/rhacs-misc/log4shell:1.0** tab to see the workload you deployed.

== 5. Apply Policy to Block Log4Shell at the build, deploy and runtime stages

Below, you will be deploying one policy that will block the log4shell vulnerability.

This policy blocks images containing the vulnerable Log4j version at build, deploy, and runtime. Execute the following commands to create the policy in the stackrox namespace:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF > block-log4shell-policy.yaml
apiVersion: config.stackrox.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-log4shell-cve-2021-44228
spec:
  policyName: block-log4shell-cve-2021-44228
  description: |
    Blocks deployments containing the Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability in Log4j.
    This policy helps prevent exploitation of a critical remote code execution vulnerability
    in affected versions of the Log4j library.
  rationale: |
    The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) is a critical security issue in the Log4j
    library that allows remote code execution and has been widely exploited. Blocking deployments
    with this vulnerability reduces the risk of compromise and lateral movement in your cluster.
  remediation: |
    Update your application dependencies to use Log4j version 2.15.0 or later, which contains
    the fix for CVE-2021-44228. Rebuild and redeploy your application images after updating.

oc apply -f block-log4shell-policy.yaml -n stackrox

== 6. Review Violations

1. In the RHACS console, go to the **Violations** page.

image::BH-violations-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
2. You should see the log4shell policy at the top of the list.

image::BH-violations-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Awesome! So we know you've "enforced" the policy. However, the workload is still running. This is because ACS will not kill a running workload to avoid disrupting the application.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -l deployment=log4shell -n log4shell
----

But if you try to redeploy the application, you will see the following error:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc create -f ~/deploy.yaml
----

[.console-output]
[source,sh]
----
Error from server (Failed currently enforced policies from RHACS): error when creating "/home/lab-user/deploy.yaml": admission webhook "policyeval.stackrox.io" denied the request: 
The attempted operation violated 1 enforced policy, described below:

In case of emergency, add the annotation {"admission.stackrox.io/break-glass": "ticket-1234"} to your deployment with an updated ticket number
----

Congrats! Moving forward no applications will be able to deploy with the vulnerable Log4j version!

== 7. Clean Up

Before you go! please Run these commands to clean up:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc delete project log4shell || true
rm -f ~/deploy.yaml
oc delete sp block-log4shell-cve-2021-44228 -n stackrox

# Remove non-default policies (including log4shell)
ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS=$(oc -n stackrox get route central -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" "https://$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS/v1/policies" | \
  jq -r '.policies[] | select(.isDefault|not) | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} curl -k -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" "https://$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS/v1/policies/{}"
----

Thanks! Enjoy Black Hat!
