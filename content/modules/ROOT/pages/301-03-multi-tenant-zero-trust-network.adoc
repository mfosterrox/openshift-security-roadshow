== Skill
Design and implement a comprehensive zero-trust network architecture for multi-tenant OpenShift environments. You will architect service mesh mutual TLS (mTLS), implement layered NetworkPolicies, configure multi-network CNIs, establish egress governance, and apply zero-trust patterns to ensure complete network segmentation and isolation.

== Objective

* Design service mesh architecture with mTLS for service-to-service communication
* Implement layered NetworkPolicies for defense-in-depth network segmentation
* Configure multi-network CNIs (Multus) for network isolation
* Establish egress governance and control policies
* Apply zero-trust patterns across the entire network architecture
* Validate network segmentation and isolation effectiveness

== Why it Matters

Multi-tenant environments require strict network isolation to prevent lateral movement and data exfiltration. Zero-trust networking assumes no implicit trust between services, requiring verification for every connection. This lab demonstrates how to architect a comprehensive zero-trust network that protects against:

* Lateral movement attacks
* Unauthorized service-to-service communication
* Data exfiltration through uncontrolled egress
* Network-based privilege escalation
* Cross-tenant data access

== What it Solves

Traditional network security relies on perimeter defense and implicit trust within the network. Zero-trust architecture eliminates these assumptions by:

* Requiring authentication and authorization for every connection
* Implementing micro-segmentation at the service level
* Enforcing least-privilege network access
* Providing visibility into all network flows
* Enabling granular policy enforcement

|===
|Component | Purpose | OpenShift/K8s Implementation
|Service Mesh mTLS | Encrypt and authenticate all service-to-service traffic | Service Mesh (Istio/OSSM) with mTLS enabled
|Layered NetworkPolicies | Defense-in-depth network segmentation | Multiple NetworkPolicy layers (namespace, pod, service)
|Multi-Network CNIs | Isolated network planes for different workloads | Multus CNI with multiple network attachments
|Egress Governance | Control and monitor outbound traffic | Egress NetworkPolicies, EgressIP, Egress Firewall
|Zero-Trust Patterns | No implicit trust, verify everything | Policy-driven access control at every layer
