== Skill
Lead organizational security culture transformation by developing enablement programs, establishing documentation standards, creating internal security guilds, and building maturity roadmaps that guide teams toward security excellence.

== Objective

* Design and implement security enablement programs
* Establish documentation standards for security practices
* Create and lead internal security guilds or communities
* Develop maturity roadmaps for security practices
* Coach teams on security best practices
* Measure and improve security culture maturity

== Why it Matters

Security culture is foundational to effective security:

* **Security by Design**: Teams build security into their work from the start
* **Shared Responsibility**: Security becomes everyone's responsibility
* **Continuous Improvement**: Teams continuously mature their security practices
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Best practices spread across the organization
* **Reduced Friction**: Security becomes an enabler, not a blocker
* **Sustainable Security**: Security practices become self-sustaining

== What it Solves

Organizations face security culture challenges:

* Security is seen as a separate team's responsibility
* Teams lack security knowledge and skills
* Security practices are inconsistent across teams
* Documentation is missing or outdated
* Security improvements happen in isolation
* Maturity improvements lack structure and measurement

This lab addresses these by:

* Creating enablement programs that build security skills
* Establishing standards that ensure consistency
* Forming communities that share knowledge
* Providing roadmaps that guide improvement
* Coaching teams to adopt security practices
* Measuring maturity to track progress
