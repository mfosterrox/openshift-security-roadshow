== Skill
Implement zero-trust workload identity frameworks and confidential computing capabilities in OpenShift. You will configure workload identity systems, deploy confidential execution runtimes, and leverage hardware-backed attestation mechanisms to ensure workloads run with verified identity and protected execution environments.

== Objective

* Implement workload identity frameworks for zero-trust authentication
* Configure confidential execution runtimes (Kata Containers, confidential VMs)
* Set up hardware-backed attestation mechanisms
* Design workload identity policies and trust boundaries
* Validate workload identity and attestation effectiveness
* Integrate identity verification into CI/CD pipelines

== Why it Matters

Zero-trust workload identity ensures that every workload is authenticated and authorized before execution. Confidential computing provides hardware-backed protection for sensitive workloads, ensuring:

* Workloads cannot be tampered with during execution
* Data remains encrypted even during processing
* Identity is cryptographically verified before execution
* Attestation provides proof of secure execution environment
* Protection against runtime attacks and data exfiltration

== What it Solves

Traditional workload security relies on platform-level controls. Zero-trust workload identity and confidential computing add additional layers:

* **Workload Identity**: Every workload has a cryptographically verifiable identity
* **Confidential Execution**: Workloads run in hardware-protected environments
* **Attestation**: Proof that workloads are running in trusted environments
* **Hardware Backing**: Leverage CPU features (Intel TDX, AMD SEV, etc.) for protection
* **Policy Enforcement**: Identity-based policies control workload behavior
