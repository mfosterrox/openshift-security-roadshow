== Skill
Design and implement comprehensive encryption strategies for OpenShift environments, including key management integration, service-to-service encryption architecture, and observability/audit telemetry pipeline design. You will learn to architect encryption at rest, in transit, and in use across the entire platform.

== Objective

* Integrate external key management systems (KMS) with OpenShift
* Design service-to-service encryption architecture
* Implement encryption at rest for persistent storage
* Configure observability and audit telemetry pipelines
* Design encryption key rotation strategies
* Validate encryption effectiveness and compliance

== Why it Matters

Advanced cryptography and encryption are fundamental to protecting sensitive data in cloud-native environments. This lab covers:

* Protecting data at rest in persistent volumes and etcd
* Ensuring end-to-end encryption for service communication
* Managing encryption keys securely and at scale
* Providing observability into encryption operations
* Meeting compliance requirements for data protection

== What it Solves

Modern security requirements demand encryption at multiple layers:

* **Encryption at Rest**: Protecting data stored in persistent volumes, databases, and etcd
* **Encryption in Transit**: Securing all network communications between services
* **Encryption in Use**: Protecting data during processing (confidential computing)
* **Key Management**: Centralized, secure key lifecycle management
* **Observability**: Monitoring encryption operations and key usage
