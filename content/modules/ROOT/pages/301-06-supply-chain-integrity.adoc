== Skill
Design and implement comprehensive supply chain security frameworks that ensure end-to-end integrity of artifacts, provide complete provenance tracking, generate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), and enforce supply chain policies throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

== Objective

* Implement artifact signing frameworks for images and binaries
* Generate and attest SBOMs for all artifacts
* Establish supply chain assurance levels and policies
* Enforce supply chain policies at admission and runtime
* Track artifact provenance from source to deployment
* Integrate supply chain security into CI/CD pipelines

== Why it Matters

Supply chain attacks are increasingly common and dangerous:

* **Artifact Integrity**: Ensure artifacts haven't been tampered with
* **Provenance Tracking**: Know the origin and history of every artifact
* **SBOM Requirements**: Meet regulatory requirements for software transparency
* **Policy Enforcement**: Prevent unauthorized or untrusted artifacts
* **Vulnerability Management**: Track vulnerabilities through supply chain
* **Compliance**: Meet supply chain security standards (SLSA, NIST SSDF)

== What it Solves

Supply chain security challenges include:

* Artifacts lack cryptographic signatures
* Provenance information is incomplete or missing
* SBOMs are not generated or attested
* Supply chain policies are not enforced automatically
* Vulnerability tracking is fragmented
* Compliance evidence is difficult to produce

This lab addresses these by:

* Implementing comprehensive signing frameworks
* Providing complete provenance tracking
* Automating SBOM generation and attestation
* Enforcing policies at multiple enforcement points
* Integrating supply chain security throughout the lifecycle
* Creating audit trails for compliance

|===
|Component | Purpose | OpenShift/K8s Implementation
|Artifact Signing | Cryptographic signatures for artifacts | Cosign, Sigstore, signing keys, signature verification
|SBOM Generation | Software Bills of Materials | Syft, SPDX, CycloneDX, SBOM formats
|Attestation | Proof of artifact properties | In-toto attestations, SLSA provenance, policy attestations
|Supply Chain Assurance | Trust levels and policies | Assurance level definitions, policy frameworks
|Policy Enforcement | Prevent untrusted artifacts | Admission controllers, image policies, signature verification
|Provenance Tracking | Complete artifact history | Provenance metadata, attestation storage, tracking systems
