== Skill
Lead the design and implementation of platform-wide security governance frameworks and multi-team architecture decisions. You will establish security operating models, design RBAC and namespace strategies, create segmentation blueprints, and coordinate security architecture across multiple teams and organizations.

== Objective

* Design and implement a security operating model for platform-wide governance
* Create RBAC and namespace strategies that scale across multiple teams
* Develop segmentation blueprints for multi-tenant environments
* Establish governance frameworks for multi-team architecture decisions
* Design security policies and standards for platform-wide adoption
* Coordinate security architecture decisions across organizational boundaries

== Why it Matters

Platform-wide security governance ensures consistent security practices across all teams and applications. Without proper governance:

* Security practices become inconsistent across teams
* RBAC and namespace strategies become fragmented
* Network segmentation lacks coherent architecture
* Security decisions are made in isolation
* Compliance becomes difficult to maintain at scale

Effective governance provides:

* Consistent security posture across the platform
* Clear decision-making frameworks for security architecture
* Scalable RBAC and namespace strategies
* Coordinated segmentation blueprints
* Alignment between security and business objectives

== What it Solves

This lab addresses the challenges of scaling security governance:

* **Security Operating Model**: Defines how security decisions are made, who makes them, and how they're enforced
* **RBAC & Namespace Strategy**: Provides scalable patterns for access control and resource organization
* **Segmentation Blueprints**: Creates reusable templates for network and workload segmentation
* **Multi-Team Coordination**: Establishes processes for coordinating security architecture across teams
* **Governance Frameworks**: Defines policies, standards, and procedures for platform security

== Understanding the Architecture

|===
|Component | Purpose | OpenShift/K8s Implementation
|Security Operating Model | Framework for security decision-making | Governance policies, decision matrices, approval workflows
|RBAC Strategy | Scalable access control patterns | ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, namespace-level RBAC
|Namespace Strategy | Resource organization and isolation | Namespace design patterns, resource quotas, network policies
|Segmentation Blueprints | Reusable security architecture templates | NetworkPolicy templates, workload isolation patterns
|Multi-Team Coordination | Processes for cross-team security decisions | Architecture review boards, security guilds, documentation standards
