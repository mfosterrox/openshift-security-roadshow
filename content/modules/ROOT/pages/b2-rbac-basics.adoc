== Skill
Learn about OpenShift's built-in roles (view, edit, admin) and how they provide graduated levels of access without needing custom roles. You'll practically test what each role allows (from read-only access to full namespace control), understand how to safely escalate permissions step-by-step, and validate access using impersonation—no real user accounts or custom roles required.

== Objective

* Use ONLY default ClusterRoles: view, edit, admin (plus a peek at basic-user & cluster-admin context)
* Observe permission differences (read vs mutate vs manage RBAC)
* Use impersonation (`--as`) to test quickly—no custom identities or new Roles
* See how default roles map to least privilege patterns
* Avoid the “just bind cluster-admin” anti-pattern

== Why it Matters
Imagine an office where every visitor is handed the master key “to avoid delays.” Things go fine—until something disappears or a server closet is “accidentally reorganized.” Most security incidents in access control aren’t brilliant attacks; they’re ordinary over-permission. The default OpenShift roles exist so you do NOT have to invent one-off policies for common personas—and so you avoid reflexively binding cluster-admin.

Using built-in roles: (1) speeds onboarding (“Give them view only”), (2) clarifies escalation paths (progress view → edit → admin), and (3) reduces audit friction (“We rely on documented platform defaults, not bespoke YAML sprawl”). Guardrails work best when widely understood; this lab makes the built-in role intent obvious.

== What it Solves
Teams often jump straight to cluster-admin or craft ad hoc Roles because they aren’t sure what the defaults already deliver. That leads to:

* Wide blast radius (cluster-admin “temporarily” bound forever)
* Hard-to-review custom Role YAML duplicates (inconsistent patterns)
* CI/CD identities holding more verbs than needed (mutation + RBAC management)
* Confusion over “Why can’t view see secret data?” or “Why can edit not alter RoleBindings?”

Built-in roles encode sane boundaries:

* view: Read most namespaced objects (NOT secret contents, NOT RBAC objects) → safe for dashboards & troubleshooting.
* edit: All typical app mutation (deployments, configmaps, services) but still cannot change RBAC → prevents silent privilege extension.
* admin: Full namespace stewardship including Role/RoleBinding management (but not cluster-scoped ownership) → local ‘tenant admin’.
* basic-user: Lets a user get info about themselves and basic project discovery.
* cluster-admin (reference only): Superuser; bypasses almost all policy—should remain a rare operational break-glass identity.

By adopting existing defaults, you eliminate redundant YAML, ease training, and reduce accidental overreach.

|===
|Vector | Over-Permission Risk | Example Outcome
|Human User | Namespace deletion, secret exposure | Accidental wipe of workloads
|Service Account | Silent privilege creep | Backdoor pod / lateral move
|CI/CD Identity | Supply chain tampering | Deploys unsigned image
|RoleBinding Sprawl | Hidden stale grants | Former contractor retains edit
|cluster-admin Overuse | Full cluster blast radius | Global outage from one command

== How to Secure (Lifecycle View)

* Build: CI service accounts: just what’s needed to apply manifests (often edit) — never admin.
* Registry: Quay robot accounts limited to push OR pull (not both) to prevent repurposing.
* Deploy: Prefer binding built-in ClusterRoles (view/edit/admin) at namespace scope rather than authoring custom Roles prematurely.
* Runtime: Monitor audit logs or RHACS for privilege jumps (view → admin unexpectedly) and new RoleBindings.
* Governance: Periodically export bindings; compare against team roster. Remove drift quickly.

== How to Try It
We will impersonate a fictitious user name `dev-user` and only bind built-in ClusterRoles in a single namespace.

=== Create sandbox project
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project b2-rbac
----

=== Bind view (read-most objects, no writes, no RBAC changes)
[source,sh]
----
oc create rolebinding dev-view --clusterrole=view --user=dev-user
oc auth can-i get pods --as=dev-user
oc auth can-i create deployment --as=dev-user
oc auth can-i get secret/mysecret --as=dev-user || true
----
Expected: get pods = yes; create deployment = no; secret access should fail (cannot read secret contents).

=== Escalate to edit (can mutate workloads, still cannot edit RBAC)
[source,sh]
----
oc delete rolebinding dev-view
oc create rolebinding dev-edit --clusterrole=edit --user=dev-user
oc auth can-i create deployment --as=dev-user
oc auth can-i create rolebinding --as=dev-user
----
Expected: create deployment = yes; create rolebinding = no.

=== Escalate to admin (full namespace administration including RBAC objects)
[source,sh]
----
oc delete rolebinding dev-edit
oc create rolebinding dev-admin --clusterrole=admin --user=dev-user
oc auth can-i create rolebinding --as=dev-user
oc auth can-i delete secret --as=dev-user
----
Expected: both now permitted (RBAC + secret mutation) within the namespace.

=== Workload check under edit/admin
[source,sh]
----
oc create deployment sample --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi -- sleep infinity
oc get deploy --as=dev-user
----

=== ServiceAccount conservative default
[source,sh]
----
oc create sa app-sa
oc auth can-i list secrets --as=system:serviceaccount:b2-rbac:app-sa
----
Expected: denied until explicitly bound (shows default restraint for service accounts).

=== Cleanup (optional)
[source,sh]
----
oc delete project b2-rbac --wait=false
----

== FAQs
How do I quickly test a permission?:: `oc auth can-i <verb> <resource> --as=<user>` (add `-n <ns>` if needed).
Why use ClusterRole (view/edit/admin) instead of writing a Role?:: They are predefined, maintained by the platform, and widely recognized—fewer bespoke policies to audit.
Why can’t view read secret contents?:: Protects sensitive configuration; grant only when necessary.
Why can edit not change RBAC?:: Prevents silent privilege elevation by identities that can already mutate apps.
When is admin appropriate?:: When a team needs full stewardship of its namespace including RoleBindings—but still not cluster-wide control.
Should I ever bind cluster-admin to a user?:: Avoid; reserve for break-glass operations with logging and time-bound justification.
Does RBAC replace vulnerability management?:: No; it limits blast radius after compromise.

== Closing Story
Default RBAC roles are the building’s standard badge templates. Consistency shrinks review effort, prevents “temporary” superuser drift, and turns access audits from archaeology into a glance.

== Next Step Ideas

* Script a periodic “can-i” matrix for critical identities
* Enforce a rule: no direct ClusterRoleBinding unless justified in Git
* Add RHACS policy: alert when service account gains admin-level verbs
