= Installation and RHACS Cloud Service

== Module goals
.Goals
- Deploy RHACS Cloud Service Central Instance
- Install Secured Cluster Services in your EKS cluster
- Understands the secured cluster bundle and certification

== Access the EKS cluster 

We are going to use Helm to install the ACS secured cluster services in Amazon's EKS. To do this we will need admin access to the cluster with Helm install. Verify that you have both before moving on.

== Setting Up Red Hat Account and Creating Central Instance on ACS

*Procedure*

. Head on over to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes/cloud-service/trial
. Click on the *Start Your Trial* button.
. Sign up for a Red Hat account if you don't have one. (Make sure to remember your username and password!)
. Once you are in "Getting Started" tab select "Create Instance".

image::10-setup-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: You will be redirected to the *ACS Instances* page where you can view all of the central services that have been deployed.

image::10-setup-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click on *Create ACS instance*.

image::10-setup-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. Fill in your name, and select your cloud region (US East or Europe).
. Wait for the creation process to complete. Typically it is 7-10 minutes.

IMPORTANT: You need ACS Central Services to be available to deploy ACS Secured Cluster Services into the EKS Cluster. Time to stretch your legs a bit.
 
## Checking and Accessing the Central Instance

Once the RHACS Central instance is available, we will check on it's status.

*Procedure*

. Ensure the *Ready* status is showing

image::10-setup-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on the *Name* of your Central Service instance. You will be redirected to a page with all of the Central Services details and a few extra resources.

IMPORTANT: Take note of the API and roxctl URL's. It will be useful for connecting to the service later.

image::10-setup-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Click on the *Name* of your Central Service instance. You will be redirected to a page with all of the Central Services details and a few extra resources.

image::10-setup-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Click on *Open ACS Console* and login to your account.

image::10-setup-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: You should be redirected to your ACS instance at a page that looks like the one above. Ask for help if you have not reached this step. 

== Install the Secured Cluster Services Bundle 

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides security services for self-managed RHACS on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (Google GKE), and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (Microsoft AKS).

If you want to learn more abou the installation methods before proceeding you can review the resources below:

- Understand the https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/installing/acs-high-level-overview.html#install-platforms-methods_acs-high-level-overview[installation methods for different platforms].
- Understand https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/architecture/acs-architecture.html#acs-architecture_acs-architecture[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes architecture].
- Check the https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/installing/acs-default-requirements.html#acs-default-requirements[default resource requirements page].

The following list provides a high-level overview of installation steps:

- Install link: https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/installing/installing_other/install-central-other.html[Central services] on a cluster using Helm charts or the `roxctl` CLI.
- Generate and apply an https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/installing/installing_other/init-bundle-other.html#init-bundle-other[init bundle].
- Install https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.5/installing/installing_other/install-secured-cluster-other.html#install-secured-cluster-other[secured cluster resources] on each of your secured clusters.

=== Setup the helm chart command

*Procedure*

. Click on the *View installation methods" button

image::10-install-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on the *Helm chart* option

image::10-install-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Run the following command helm command to update the charts

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
helm repo add rhacs https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/rhacs/charts/
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ helm repo add rhacs https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/rhacs/charts/
"rhacs" has been added to your repositories
----

IMPORTANT: Review what is necessary for a successful Helm Chart deployment.

* You must download the YAML file for a cluster init bundle. One bundle can be used to secure multiple clusters.
* Ensure you have access to the Red Hat Container Registry and a pull secret for authentication.
* Obtain the address and port number on which you are exposing the Central service.


We are going to make this easier by using variables in our setup.

==== Create the init bundle

*Procedure*

. In the ACS Console Click on *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations* -> *Cluster Init Bundle*
. Click on the *Create bundle* button.

image::10-install-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Give the bundle a name, click *EKS cluster*, and click ok.
. Run the following command command to create a file name init.yml

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
touch init.yml
----

[start=5]
. Next, use Vi or nano to edit the file and copy the credentials into the init.yml folder.
. Confirm the file is setup properly with a cat command.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
cat init.yml
----

            -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
----

==== Obtain the address and port number on which you are exposing the Central service

This is a simple step in which you either head back to the RHACS dashboard and copy the URLs from before. Or simply copy the URL from the top of the dashboad and add port 443.

*Procedure*

. Copy the URL from the address bar. 
. add a semicolon and 443 to the end of .com while removing the rest of the the URL including the "https:". The Address should look something like this -> acs-xxxxxxxxxx.acs.rhcloud.com:443
. Run the following command with your URL to save as a shell variable.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo export ACS_URL= YOUR_URL_HERE ~/.bashrc
ACS_URL= YOUR_URL_HERE
----

[start=4]
.Verify the output

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $ACS_URL
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$ echo $ACS_URL
https://acs-cs3a2gnasu0g1ivkgbhg.acs.rhcloud.com:443
----

==== Ensure you have access to the Red Hat Container Registry and a pull secret for authentication.

Lastly, you need to add your credentials as variables and ensure you have access to Red Hat services. We won't save these but you will need them in the following step.

=== Run the helm chart command

Now it's time to run the helm chart command!

*Procedure*

.Run the following Helm command and ensure that your credentials are added.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to add your cluster name to the command.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
helm install -n stackrox --create-namespace \
   stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/secured-cluster-services \
   -f init.yml \
   --set clusterName=eks-production-cluster \
   --set centralEndpoint=$ACS_URL \
   --set imagePullSecrets.username=USERNAME \
   --set imagePullSecrets.password=PASSWORD
----

IMPORTANT: The imagePullSecrets.username is the *username* for your account and *not* your email.

Make sure to replace the placeholders with actual values specific to your RHACS environment before deploying.

== Deploy the workshop applications (AGAIN...)

In the final part of this module, you'll deploy several insecure applications to the OpenShift cluster. You'll scan a few of these containers using the *roxctl* CLI to understand what you're deploying and what to expect when you dive into RHACS.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the variables are set before running the following commands. If not, go back to the Quay section to redo the previous commands.

====
Run the following in the terminal and ensure you get the corrrect outputs.
====

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
echo $QUAY_USER
echo $QUAY_URL
----

Our insecure demo applications come from a variety of public GitHub repositories and sources. Including the Java application that you just pushed to Quay. Let's deploy them into our cluster.

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Run the following commands in the terminal, one after the other.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc config use-context admin
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
[lab-user@bastion ~]$oc config use-context eks-admin
Switched to context "admin".
----

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ --recursive
----

Now it's time to review the results!
