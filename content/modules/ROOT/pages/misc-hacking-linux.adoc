= Capture the Flag

== Module goals
.Goals
* A CTF challenge: Web hacking a running container on OpenShift
* There are three flags found during the journey.

== The CTF challenge

This vulnerable web application is intentionally designed with minimal interaction but contains flaws that can be exploited through SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. There are three hidden flags to discover.

Have fun exploring!

== Getting access

Start by networking the running container so that you can access it. The following commands deploy our vulnerable container to EKS and creates a LoadBalancer service to make it publicly accessible. 

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc config use-context eks-admin
export TUTORIAL_HOME="$(pwd)/demo-apps"
oc apply -f $TUTORIAL_HOME/kubernetes-manifests/ctf-web-to-system/ctf-w2s.yml
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Switched to context "eks-admin".
service/ctf-web-to-system-service unchanged
deployment.apps/ctf-web-to-system configured
----

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc ctf-web-to-system-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}'
----

IMPORTANT: Use the amazonaws.com link to access the vulnerable container
