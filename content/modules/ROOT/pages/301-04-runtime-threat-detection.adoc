== Skill
Design and implement comprehensive runtime threat detection pipelines that continuously monitor workloads, enrich telemetry data, route alerts effectively, and integrate seamlessly into incident response workflows with pre-defined playbooks.

== Objective

* Develop runtime detection rulesets for common attack patterns
* Implement streaming telemetry enrichment and correlation
* Design alert routing and escalation workflows
* Create pre-incident response playbooks
* Integrate detection pipelines with SIEM/SOAR platforms
* Validate detection effectiveness through testing

== Why it Matters

Runtime threat detection is critical for identifying active attacks:

* **Early Detection**: Identify threats before significant damage occurs
* **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 surveillance of runtime behavior
* **Context Enrichment**: Correlate events to understand attack patterns
* **Automated Response**: Trigger response actions automatically
* **Investigation Readiness**: Pre-defined playbooks accelerate response
* **Threat Intelligence**: Integrate external threat feeds

== What it Solves

Traditional security monitoring faces limitations:

* Detection rules are static and miss novel attacks
* Telemetry lacks context and correlation
* Alerts overwhelm security teams with noise
* Response workflows are ad-hoc and slow
* Integration between tools is manual and fragmented

Advanced detection pipelines solve these by:

* Using behavioral analysis and anomaly detection
* Enriching telemetry with context and threat intelligence
* Implementing intelligent alert routing and filtering
* Automating response through playbooks
* Integrating seamlessly with existing security tools

|===
|Component | Purpose | OpenShift/K8s Implementation
|Runtime Detection Rulesets | Identify attack patterns and anomalies | Falco rules, custom detection logic, ML models
|Streaming Telemetry | Real-time event collection and processing | Prometheus, Fluentd, OpenTelemetry, event streams
|Telemetry Enrichment | Add context and threat intelligence | Enrichment pipelines, threat intel feeds, correlation engines
|Alert Routing | Intelligent alert distribution | AlertManager, notification systems, escalation policies
|Response Playbooks | Pre-defined incident response procedures | SOAR platforms, automation scripts, runbooks
|SIEM/SOAR Integration | Centralized security operations | Log aggregation, event correlation, automation platforms
