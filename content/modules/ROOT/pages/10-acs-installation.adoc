== Module goals
.Goals
- Deploy RHACS Cloud Service Central Instance
- Remove the existing RHACS operator
- Use the ACS Cloud Service to reinstall the Secured Cluster Services

== Setting Up Red Hat Account and Creating Central Instance on ACS

*Procedure*

. Head on over to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes/cloud-service/trial[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Trial]
. Click on the *Start Your Trial* button.
. Sign up for a Red Hat account if you don't have one. (Make sure to remember your username and password!)
. Once you are in "Getting Started" tab select "Create Instance".

NOTE: You will be redirected to the *ACS Instances* page where you can view all of the central services that have been deployed.

image::11-setup-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click on *Create ACS instance*.

image::11-setup-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. Fill in your name, and select your cloud region (US East or Europe).
. Wait for the creation process to complete. Typically it is 7-10 minutes.

IMPORTANT: You need ACS Central Services to be available to deploy ACS Secured Cluster Services into the EKS Cluster. Time to stretch your legs a bit.
 
## Checking and Accessing the Central Instance

Once the RHACS Central instance is available, we will check on it's status.

*Procedure*

. Ensure the *Ready* status is showing

image::11-setup-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on the *Name* of your Central Service instance. You will be redirected to a page with all of the Central Services details and a few extra resources.

IMPORTANT: Take note of the API and roxctl URL's. It will be useful for connecting to the service later.

[start=3]
. Click on the *Name* of your Central Service instance. You will be redirected to a page with all of the Central Services details and a few extra resources.

image::11-setup-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Click on *Open ACS Console* and login to your account.

image::11-setup-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: You should be redirected to your ACS instance at a page that looks like the one above. Ask for help if you have not reached this step. 

== Uninstall the "On-Prem" RHACS Operator

While you're waiting for the Central Services to spin up, head over to the OpenShift console to unstall the existing operator. 

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Log into the OCP console at `{web_console_url}`
. Click on Operators - Installed Operators

image::11-uninstall-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Locate the Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Operator and select it. 
. Click on Actions, then click Uninstall Operator

image::11-uninstall-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Select "Delete all operand instances for this operator"
. Click uninstall.

image::11-uninstall-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

image::11-uninstall-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: If successfull, you will have no access to the RHACS console at `{acs_route}`

Let's check out the RHACS Cloud Service instance.

== Access the Cloud Service and Install the Secured Cluster Services

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides security services for self-managed RHACS on platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (Google GKE), and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (Microsoft AKS).

If you want to learn more about the installation methods before proceeding you can review the resource below:

- Understand the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/4.7/html/installing/high-level-rhacs-installation-overview[installation methods for different platforms].

=== Setup the SCS certificates

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Head back over to your RHACS instance.

image::11-cs-00.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on your instance then select, "Open ACS Console".

image::11-cs-01.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]
. Click on your instance then select, "Open ACS Console".
. Login using your Red Hat credentials

IMPORTANT: Ask for help from you instructor if you are having issues with the RHACS Cloud Service instance or access. 

image::11-cs-02.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Select "View installation methods".

image::11-cs-03.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: Since we have an OpenShift Cluster, you will be using the Operator method to install the Secured Cluster Services in OpenShift.

*To install the Operator two things have to be done*

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console on the cluster that you are securing, you have installed the RHACS Operator.
2. In the RHACS web portal, you have created an init bundle and downloaded the YAML file for the init bundle.

*Let's start by grabbing the init secrets*

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. In your RHACS Cloud Service instance, select "Platform Configuration - Cluster Init Bundle"

image::11-cs-04.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Select "Create bundle".
. Name the bundle "new-cluster"
. Ensure OpenShift & Operator are selected

image::11-cs-05.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click *Download*
. Next you need to copy the file contents and save it in a new file named *init-bundle.yaml*

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
nano init-bundle.yaml
----

NOTE: Hit ctrl + x to exit nano.

[start=7]
. Run the following on your command line:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc delete -f init-bundle.yaml -n rhacs-operator
oc create -f init-bundle.yaml -n rhacs-operator
----

NOTE: You are running the delete command to ensure the previous certificates are removed. 

=== Install the operator

*Procedure*

[start=1]
. Log into the OCP console at `{web_console_url}`
. Click on Operators - Operator Hub
. Search for RHACS and click on the one with the "Red Hat" source

image::11-cs-06.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. Click *Install*
. Ensure the existing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform project *rhacs-operator* is selected.
. Click *Install*

image::11-cs-07.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

NOTE: With the init-bundle deployed and the operator ready, it's time to install the *Secured Cluster*

[start=7]
. Click on the *Secured Cluster* tab then select "Create SecuredCluster"

image::11-cs-08.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=8]
. Use all of the defaults but change the cluster name to *new-cluster*
. Add the *Central Endpoint* of your ACS Cloud Service. This can be foudn in the console.openshift or the URL at the top of the page.  
. Click "Install"

image::11-cs-09.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

IMPORTANT: After a few minutes you should see everything light up green in the Cloud Service console.
