* Schedule a scan in the Compliance Coverage dashboard

== Compliance Operator and Compliance in ACS

The OpenShift Compliance Operator allows OpenShift Container Platform administrators to define the desired compliance state of a cluster and provides an overview of gaps and ways to remediate any non-compliant policy.

The OpenShift Compliance Operator assesses both Kubernetes API resources and OpenShift Container Platform resources, as well as the nodes running the cluster. The Compliance Operator uses OpenSCAP, a NIST-certified tool, to scan and enforce security policies provided by the content.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) supports OpenShift Container Platform configuration compliance standards through an integration with the OpenShift Container Platform Compliance Operator. In addition, it allows you to measure and report on configuration security best practices for OpenShift Container Platform.

== Install the Compliance Operator

.Procedure
. Log into the OCP console at `{web_console_url}`
. Click the *rhsso* option
. Enter the OCP credentials 

[cols="1,1"]
|===
*User:*| {openshift_admin_user} |
*Password:*| {openshift_admin_password} |
|===

image::01-ocp-login-admin.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=4]
. In the web console, go to the Operators → OperatorHub page.
. Enter compliance operator into the Filter by keyword box to find the Compliance Operator.

image::07-comp-1.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=6]
. Select the Compliance Operator to view the details page.
. Read the information about the Operator, select the defaults, and then click Install.

image::07-comp-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Since RHACS was installed prior to the Compliance Operator, we’ll need to restart the ACS sensor in the OpenShift cluster to see these results.

[start=8]
. Run the following command to restart the RHACS scanner pod. This will speed up the process for the profiles to appear in RHACS Central.


[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=sensor -n stackrox
----

With the Sensor restarted, kick off a compliance scan in ACS to see the updated results

== Configuring the ScanSettingBinding object

Now, before the Compliance Coverage dashboard and ACS users would have had to set up a ScanSettingBinding object to schedule their compliance operator schedules this can be done in RHACS.

But you still have to set your compliance profiles. 

== Configuring the Compliance Operator ProfileBundles

The `ProfileBundle` object requires two pieces of information: the URL of a container image that contains the contentImage and the file that contains the compliance content. The contentFile parameter is relative to the root of the file system. You can define the built-in `rhcos4` `ProfileBundle` object as shown in the following example:

```YAML
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ProfileBundle
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-10-19T12:06:30Z"
  finalizers:
  - profilebundle.finalizers.compliance.openshift.io
  generation: 1
  name: rhcos4
  namespace: openshift-compliance
  resourceVersion: "46741"
  uid: 22350850-af4a-4f5c-9a42-5e7b68b82d7d
spec:
  contentFile: ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml 
  contentImage: registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:900e... 
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-10-19T12:07:51Z"
    message: Profile bundle successfully parsed
    reason: Valid
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  dataStreamStatus: VALID
```

Let's look at the default ProfileBundles in OpenShift

.Procedure
. Run an "oc" command to look at the default ProfileBundles.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc get -n openshift-compliance profilebundle.compliance
----

*Sample Output*

[source,sh]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ oc get -n openshift-compliance profilebundle.compliance
NAME     CONTENTIMAGE                                                                                                                               CONTENTFILE         STATUS
ocp4     registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:dee91b7c0551a01fe2a3e6fcf3788e76f3ab5be8daa5ca59709840af6592203a   ssg-ocp4-ds.xml     VALID
rhcos4   registry.redhat.io/compliance/openshift-compliance-content-rhel8@sha256:dee91b7c0551a01fe2a3e6fcf3788e76f3ab5be8daa5ca59709840af6592203a   ssg-rhcos4-ds.xml   VALID
----

So we have profiles. Now it's time to create a scan. 

== Execute your first Compliance Scan

When installing RHACS you need to kick off a complaince scan to ensure that the Compliance results are available. So let’s execute our first compliance scan.

.Procedure
. Head to the Compliance -> Dashboard
. Click the "Scan environment" button on the top left.

image::07-comp-3.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=3]

Wait a few seconds and your dashboard should populate.

== Review the Compliance Reports in the Compliance Dashboard

The compliance reports gather information for configuration, industry standards, and best practices for container-based workloads running in Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Each standard represents a series of controls, with guidance provided by RHACS on the specific OpenShift configuration or DevOps process required to meet that control.

*Let's review the dashboard.*

In the top right of the dashboard you will see two of the dropdown options
 
image::07-comp-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

* Manage standards &
* Export

*Click the "Manage standards button"*

image::07-comp-6.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You will see all of the standards available to you in the dashboard. These standards will effect ALL of the controls that you see in the dashboad. For example;

*Remove all of the options except NIST SP 800-53.*

image::07-comp-8.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

And you should end up with a dashboard that looks like this

image::07-comp-9.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

Focusing on the standards that matter most to you is essential for reducing unnecessary noise in the UI.

IMPORTANT: add all the standards back before progressing to the next section

*Click the "Manage standards button"*

. Click on PCI, or the PCI percentage bar, in the upper-left “Passing Standards Across Clusters” graph

image::07-comp-4.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Click on Control 1.1.4, “Requirements for a firewall…”

image::07-comp-5.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

For example, PCI-DSS has controls that refer to firewalls and DMZ - not exactly cloud-native

In OpenShift, that requirement, and other isolation requirements, is met by Network Policies, and the 6% compliance score here indicates that very few deployments have correctly defined policies.

=== Evidence Export
Last thing about compliance - you’re only as compliant as you can prove!

. Click on the Export button in the upper right to show the “Download evidence as CSV” option

This is the evidence export that your auditors will want to see for proof that the security controls mandated are actually in place.

|====
How would you bring this standard up to 100%?
|====

== Managing the Compliance Coverage feature (Technology Preview)

You can view the compliance results associated with your cluster by using the Compliance Coverage feature in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) portal. The feature collects compliance information gathered by the Compliance Operator into a single interface.

Currently, the Compliance Coverage feature and the Compliance Operator evaluate only infrastructure and platform compliance.

=== Viewing the cluster compliance page

By viewing the cluster compliance page, you can get a comprehensive overview of the compliance status of your clusters.

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance → Coverage tab.

image::07-comp-10.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

The cluster compliance page organizes information in the following groups:

*1. Cluster:* Gives the details of your cluster and provides a snapshot of its current state and configurations.

*2. Operator status:* Assesses the health and operational status of the Compliance Operator instance within your cluster and ensures that the Operator is running optimally and functioning seamlessly.

*3. Compliance:* Shows the percentage of checks that have been passed for the scanned profiles.

====
There is currently nothing in the coverage dashboard since no schedule has been created yet!
====

image::07-comp-11.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Creating a compliance scan schedule

By creating a compliance scan schedule, you can customize and automate your compliance scans to align with your operational requirements.

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the Compliance → Schedules tab.
. Click Create scan schedule. 

IMPORTANT: Pick a schedule that is daily and a few minutes from now. As you will want to see the results soon after creation and not wait a day for results!

In the Configuration options page, provide the following information:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Name: | Enter a name to identify different compliance scans.
| Description: | Specify the reason for each compliance scan.
| Configure schedule: | Adjust the scan schedule to fit your required schedule:
| Frequency: | From the drop-down list, select how often you want to perform the scan. Frequencies include Daily, Weekly, and Monthly.
| On day(s): | From the list, select one or more days of the week on which you want to perform the scan. Valid values include Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, The first of the month, and The middle of the month.
*These values are only applicable if you specify the frequency of scan as Weekly or Monthly.*
| Time: | Start to type the time in hh:mm at which you want to run the scan. From the list that is displayed, select a time.
|===

[start=3]
. Click Next.

. In the Clusters page, select one or more clusters that you want to include in the scan.

image::07-comp-12.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=5]
. Click *Next*.
. In the Profiles page, select the *ocp4-cis* profile. This is the most up to date CIS benchmarks for OpenShift Container Platform 4.
. Click *Next*.
. Review your scan configuration, and then click Create.

|====
Wait until the Compliance Operator returns the scan results. It might take a few minutes.
|====

=== Viewing the compliance scan status

By viewing the status of a compliance scan, you can efficiently monitor and analyze the health of your clusters. Let's take a look!

.Procedure
. In the RHACS portal, go to the *Compliance* → *Coverage* tab.
. Select the compliance scan you have created.

image::07-comp-13.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

=== Compliance scan status overview

The scans will have varying results. Review the options that will show up in RHACS.

OPTIONAL: From the Compliance status drop-down list, select one or more statuses by using which you want to filter the scan details. Compliance statuses include Pass, Fail, Error, Info, Manual, Not Applicable, and Inconsistent.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| Status 
| Description
| Fail 
| The compliance check failed.
| Pass 
| The compliance check passed.
| Not Applicable 
| Skipped the compliance check because it was not applicable.
| Info 
| The compliance check gathered data, but RHACS could not make a pass or fail determination.
| Error 
| The compliance check failed due to a technical issue.
| Manual 
| Manual intervention is required to ensure compliance.
| Inconsistent 
| The compliance scan data is inconsistent, and requires closer inspection and targeted resolution.
|=== 

|====
The scan shows 60 passing controls, 8 failing controls and 21 manual controls. 
|====

Let's dive a little deeper.

.Procedure
. Sort the scan by the *Fail* status only.

image::07-comp-14.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

[start=2]
. Review the failing standard called 'ocp4-cis-configure-network-policies-namespaces'

image::07-comp-15.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]

You'll notice in details it gives you a Rationale, Description and Instructions on how to ensure a passing grade in the future. Let's try running those commands.

[start=3]
. Run the following command to get all the non-control plane namespaces.

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc get  namespaces -o json | jq '[.items[] | select((.metadata.name | startswith("openshift") | not) and (.metadata.name | startswith("kube-") | not) and .metadata.name != "default") | .metadata.name ]'
----

*Sample Output*

[source,sh]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ oc get  namespaces -o json | jq '[.items[] | select((.metadata.name | startswith("openshift") | not) and (.metadata.name | startswith("kube-") | not) and .metadata.name != "default") | .metadata.name ]'
[
  "backend",
...
  "vault"
]
----

[start=4]
. Next, compare this list to the previous one. To get all the non-control plane namespaces with a NetworkPolicy, run the following command

[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc get networkpolicies -A -o json | jq '[.items[] | select((.metadata.namespace | startswith("openshift") | not) and (.metadata.namespace | startswith("kube-") | not) and .metadata.namespace != "default") | .metadata.namespace] | unique'
----

*Sample Output*

[source,sh]
----
[lab-user@bastion pipeline]$ oc get --all-namespaces networkpolicies -o json | jq '[.items[] | select((.metadata.namespace | startswith("openshift") | not) and (.metadata.namespace | startswith("kube-") | not) and .metadata.namespace != "default") | .metadata.namespace] | unique'
[
  "janus-argocd",
  "medical",
  "sonataflow-infra",
  "stackrox",
  "trusted-profile-analyzer",
  "vault"
]
----

> It's great to know that StackRox (RHACS) is covered!

It the Networking section we will go about fixing this issue through the generation and application of network policy. For now I offer you a challenge.
