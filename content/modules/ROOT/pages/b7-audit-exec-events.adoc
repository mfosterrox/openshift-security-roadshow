== Skill
Learn to analyze OpenShift API audit logs to spot risky activity across the board—exec, port‑forward, secret access, RBAC changes, and other sensitive verbs—and turn findings into a concise, attributable incident report.

== Objective

* Locate exec & port-forward events
* Attribute to identities
* Summarize commands, source IPs, timing
* Produce structured report

== Why it Matters
Audit logs are the security camera for API actions—who did what, when, and from where. They turn guesswork into evidence, speeding investigations and proving compliance.

== What it Solves

* Reduces downtime in incident reconstruction
* Prevents disputes over actions
* Supports least privilege validation

|===
|Event Type | Risk | Example
|pod/exec | Command injection / exfil | Insider dumps DB
|pod/portforward | Tunneling internal svc | Expose admin console
|Privilege Grant (rolebinding) | Escalation | Enables later exec
|Secrets get/list | Credential harvest | Stage follow-on attack
|===

== How to Secure (Lifecycle View)
* Build: IaC RBAC—drift stands out.
* Registry: Harden images → fewer live debug execs.
* Deploy: Restrict who can exec/port-forward.
* Runtime: Ship audit logs to SIEM; alert on anomalies.

== How to Try It
Assuming `audit.json` file (JSON lines).

=== Basic presence check
[source,sh]
----
ls -l audit.json
----

=== Extract exec events
[source,sh]
----
jq 'select(.objectRef.subresource=="exec") | {time:.requestReceivedTimestamp,user:.user.username,ns:.objectRef.namespace,pod:.objectRef.name,cmd:.requestObject.command}' audit.json
----
Fallback:
[source,sh]
----
grep -F '"exec"' audit.json | head
----

=== Extract port-forward events
[source,sh]
----
jq 'select(.objectRef.subresource=="portforward") | {time:.requestReceivedTimestamp,user:.user.username,ns:.objectRef.namespace,pod:.objectRef.name}' audit.json
----

=== Focus on suspected user
[source,sh]
----
USER=suspect@example.com
jq --arg U "$USER" 'select(.user.username==$U and (.objectRef.subresource=="exec" or .objectRef.subresource=="portforward")) | {time:.requestReceivedTimestamp,sub:.objectRef.subresource,pod:.objectRef.name,ns:.objectRef.namespace,sourceIPs:.sourceIPs}' audit.json
----

=== Stage distribution
[source,sh]
----
jq 'select(.objectRef.subresource=="exec") | .stage' audit.json | sort | uniq -c
----

=== Unique exec actors
[source,sh]
----
jq 'select(.objectRef.subresource=="exec") | .user.username' audit.json | sort | uniq -c
----

=== Commands (if captured)
[source,sh]
----
jq 'select(.objectRef.subresource=="exec") | .requestObject.command' audit.json | sort | uniq -c
----

== Solutions / Controls

* Central log aggregation (immutability)
* RHACS correlation with runtime
* Least privilege RBAC
* Alert rules on unusual volume/time

|What to Track | Why | Tooling
|exec Events | Potential tampering | jq / SIEM search
|portforward | Data channel creation | Alert on frequency
|RoleBinding Changes | Escalation path | GitOps diff + audit
|Secret Access | Credential theft | SIEM correlation

== FAQs
Are audit logs enabled by default?:: OpenShift enables them; verify retention & shipping.
Why might a command not appear?:: Request object detail may be trimmed.
How long keep logs?:: Align with compliance (90–365d typical).
Does this replace runtime detection?:: No—complements container-level signals.

== Closing Story
Audit logs are a time machine—without them investigation is guesswork, not evidence.

== Next Step Ideas

* Daily exec counts per user summary
* Correlate events with workload restarts
* Integrate RHACS alerts into incident pipeline
