== Overview

These advanced labs cover enterprise-grade security architectures and patterns for OpenShift environments. You'll learn to design and implement zero-trust networking, advanced cryptography, and confidential computing solutions.

Advanced capabilities covered:

* Platform-wide security governance and multi-team architecture - A1
* GitOps-driven policy and compliance pipelines - A2
* Multi-tenant zero-trust network segmentation - A3
* Runtime threat detection and response workflows - A4
* Incident response and forensic investigation - A5
* End-to-end supply chain integrity and provenance - A6
* Automated remediation and policy enforcement - A7
* Security culture and maturity programs - A8
* Advanced cryptography and encryption strategies - A9
* Zero-trust workload identity and confidential computing - A10

What you'll practice:

* Leading platform-wide security governance and architecture decisions
* Implementing GitOps-driven policy and compliance pipelines
* Architecting service mesh mTLS and layered NetworkPolicies
* Engineering runtime threat detection and response workflows
* Leading incident response and forensic investigations
* Establishing supply chain integrity and artifact provenance
* Automating remediation and policy enforcement
* Driving security culture and maturity improvements
* Integrating key management and encryption strategies
* Configuring workload identity and confidential computing

Audience and prerequisites:

* Red Hat OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin access
* For security architects, platform engineers, and senior security practitioners
* Requires deep understanding of OpenShift networking, security, and architecture
* Advanced knowledge of cryptography, key management, and confidential computing concepts
