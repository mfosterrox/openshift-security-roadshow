This course offers you hands-on experience working with the essential security use cases of Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) with Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain (TSSC).

== Lab homepage

Most of the lab will take place in this *Showroom* lab environment and between various Red Hat product user interfaces (UI).

Below, you can find all the URLs and passwords needed to complete the lab on the homepage. If you ever get lost simply click the home button at the top of the webpage to find the essentials.

IMPORTANT: This is the *HOME* page. The modules can be found by clicking the table of contents on the left side of the screen or by scrolling to the bottom of each module and clicking *Next*.

TIP: Always open console URLs in a new tab so you can keep this lab guide open. On a Mac, use *<cmd> click*; on Windows/Linux, use *<ctrl> click* or right-click and select "Open in new tab."

== Before you begin

* *Bookmark this page* — You will return here for credentials and links.
* *Use the bastion host* — Many steps use the `oc`, `roxctl`, and `podman` CLIs; these run on the RHEL bastion. SSH access details are in the table below.
* *Follow modules in order* — Start with xref:00-acs-setup-install-navigation.adoc[Lab Setup and Introduction] (module 00), then proceed through the modules in sequence. Each module builds on the previous one.

== All lab components

During the roadshow, you will utilize the following applications to complete all of the lab tasks:

* Red Hat^(R)^ OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) console
* Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) console with OpenShift GitOps (ArgoCD)
* Red Hat^(R)^ Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) console
* Red Hat^(R)^ Quay console
* Red Hat^(R)^ Trusted Application Signer (RHTAS)
* Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux (RHEL) bastion host (The "Showroom" lab environment)
